.. that users understand how the changes affect the new version.

version 0.3.0-dev
-----------------
+ Added a source tarball for isa-l in the package, so it can be compiled and
  statically linked on (unix) systems that do not have isa-l available in the
  repos. Linux wheels can be provided on PYPI as well because of this change.

version 0.2.0
-----------------
+ Fixed a bug where writing of the gzip header would crash if an older version
  of Python 3.7 was used such as on Debian or Ubuntu. This is due to
  differences between point releases because of a backported feature. The code
  now checks if the backported feature is present.
+ Added Python 3.9 to the testing.
+ Fixed ``setup.py`` to list setuptools as a requirement.
+ Changed homepage to reflect move to pycompression organization.

version 0.1.0
-----------------
+ Publish API documentation on readthedocs.
+ Add API documentation.
+ Ensure the igzip module is fully compatible with the gzip stdlib module.
+ Add compliance tests from CPython to ensure isal_zlib and igzip are validated
  to the same standards as the zlib and gzip modules.
+ Added a working gzip app using ``python -m isal.igzip``
+ Add test suite that tests all possible settings for functions on the
  isal_zlib module.
+ Create igzip module which implements all gzip functions and methods.
+ Create isal_zlib module which implements all zlib functions and methods.
